As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the red block
put down the blue block
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
stack the red block on top of the blue block

put down the orange block
unstack the red block from on top of the blue block
stack the red block on top of the yellow block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the red block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
