As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
put down the yellow block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]
