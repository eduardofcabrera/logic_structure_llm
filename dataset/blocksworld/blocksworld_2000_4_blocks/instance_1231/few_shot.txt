As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the yellow block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
