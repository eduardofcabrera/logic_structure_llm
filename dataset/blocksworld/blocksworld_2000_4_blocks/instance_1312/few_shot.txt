As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

stack the red block on top of the blue block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block
