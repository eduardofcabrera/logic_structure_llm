As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the blue block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
put down the red block
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
put down the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
put down the yellow block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the yellow block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
