As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block
put down the blue block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
put down the red block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
stack the yellow block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
