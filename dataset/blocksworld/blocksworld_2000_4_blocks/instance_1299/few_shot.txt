As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]

pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
