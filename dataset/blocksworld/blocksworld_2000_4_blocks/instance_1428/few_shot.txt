As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the orange block is on top of the blue block.
