As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block
put down the orange block

put down the blue block
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block

pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the red block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the orange block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
