As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
put down the yellow block
unstack the blue block from on top of the red block
stack the blue block on top of the yellow block
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
