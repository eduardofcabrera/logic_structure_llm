As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the orange block from on top of the red block
put down the orange block
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
put down the yellow block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the red block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
