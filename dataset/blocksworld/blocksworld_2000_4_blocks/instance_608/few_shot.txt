As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN END]
