As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block
put down the yellow block
unstack the orange block from on top of the red block
stack the orange block on top of the yellow block
unstack the red block from on top of the blue block
put down the red block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the red block
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
stack the orange block on top of the blue block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
