As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the red block
put down the blue block
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
