As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block
put down the orange block
unstack the blue block from on top of the red block
stack the blue block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
