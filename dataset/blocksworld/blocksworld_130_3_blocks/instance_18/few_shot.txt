As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block
put down the orange block
unstack the blue block from on top of the red block
put down the blue block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
