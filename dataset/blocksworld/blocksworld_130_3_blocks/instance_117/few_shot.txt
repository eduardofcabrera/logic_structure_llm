As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the red block from on top of the blue block
put down the red block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]
