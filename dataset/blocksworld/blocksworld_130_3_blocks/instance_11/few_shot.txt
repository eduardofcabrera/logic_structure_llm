As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
unstack the orange block from on top of the red block
put down the orange block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
