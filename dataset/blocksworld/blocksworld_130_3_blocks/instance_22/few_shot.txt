As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the orange block from on top of the red block
put down the orange block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
