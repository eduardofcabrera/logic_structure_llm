As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the yellow block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the red block from on top of the white block
put down the red block
unstack the white block from on top of the yellow block
put down the white block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]
