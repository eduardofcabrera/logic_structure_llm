As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block and the white block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

stack the blue block on top of the red block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the blue block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the orange block
pick up the white block
stack the white block on top of the yellow block
[PLAN END]
