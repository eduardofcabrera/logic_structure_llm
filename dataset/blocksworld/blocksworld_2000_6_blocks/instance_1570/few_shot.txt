As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the white block.

My plan is as follows:

unstack the blue block from on top of the white block
put down the blue block

stack the orange block on top of the blue block
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block
put down the red block

[PLAN END]
