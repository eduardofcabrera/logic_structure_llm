As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the white block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the red block and the orange block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
put down the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block

unstack the white block from on top of the blue block

pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the red block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
