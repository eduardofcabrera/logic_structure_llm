As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the red block, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the white block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the white block from on top of the red block
put down the white block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the red block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the white block
[PLAN END]
