As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]

put down the white block
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
