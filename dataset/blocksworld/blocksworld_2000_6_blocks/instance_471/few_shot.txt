As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the white block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
pick up the white block
stack the white block on top of the yellow block
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
put down the red block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]
