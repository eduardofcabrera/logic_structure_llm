As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the white block, the white block is on top of the blue block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the white block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the white block
put down the yellow block
unstack the white block from on top of the blue block
put down the white block
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
stack the blue block on top of the yellow block
pick up the white block
stack the white block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
