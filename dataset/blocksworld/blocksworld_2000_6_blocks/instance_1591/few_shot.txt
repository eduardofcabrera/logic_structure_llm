As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the white block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

pick up the blue block

[PLAN END]
