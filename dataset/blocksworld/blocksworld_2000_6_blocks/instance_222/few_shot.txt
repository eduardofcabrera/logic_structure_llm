As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the white block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
put down the red block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the red block
unstack the white block from on top of the blue block
put down the white block
unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block
stack the blue block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
