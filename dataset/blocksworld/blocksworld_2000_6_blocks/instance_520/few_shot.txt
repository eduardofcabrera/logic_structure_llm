As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the white block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
stack the yellow block on top of the white block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the yellow block
[PLAN END]
