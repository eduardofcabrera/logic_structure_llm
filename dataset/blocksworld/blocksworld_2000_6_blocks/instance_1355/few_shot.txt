As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the red block
unstack the white block from on top of the yellow block
put down the white block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
