As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the white block, the white block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the orange block is on top of the white block.
