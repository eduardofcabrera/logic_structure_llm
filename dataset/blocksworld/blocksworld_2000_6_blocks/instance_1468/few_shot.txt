As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the white block, the red block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the white block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
unstack the orange block from on top of the white block
put down the orange block
pick up the white block
stack the white block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
