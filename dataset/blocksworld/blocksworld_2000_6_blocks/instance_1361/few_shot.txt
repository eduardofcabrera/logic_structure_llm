As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the white block is on top of the yellow block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the white block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
unstack the orange block from on top of the white block
put down the orange block
unstack the white block from on top of the yellow block
stack the white block on top of the orange block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the yellow block
unstack the white block from on top of the orange block
stack the white block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
