As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the white block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

put down the blue block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the blue block
unstack the red block from on top of the white block

[PLAN END]
