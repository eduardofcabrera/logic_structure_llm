As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the white block and the white block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
pick up the white block
stack the white block on top of the blue block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block
stack the yellow block on top of the white block
[PLAN END]
