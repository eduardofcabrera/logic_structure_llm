As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on top of the white block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.
