As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the white block, the white block is on top of the red block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the white block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the orange block from on top of the white block
put down the orange block
unstack the white block from on top of the red block
stack the white block on top of the blue block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the white block
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block
put down the red block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]
