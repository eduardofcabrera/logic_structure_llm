As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the white block is on top of the blue block.

stack the white block on top of the blue block
unstack the orange block from on top of the red block

stack the red block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
