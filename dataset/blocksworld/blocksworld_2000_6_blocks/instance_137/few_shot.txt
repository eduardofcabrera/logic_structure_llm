As initial conditions I have that, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the red block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the white block and the white block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the white block from on top of the red block
put down the white block
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
put down the red block
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
put down the orange block
pick up the white block
stack the white block on top of the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
stack the yellow block on top of the white block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
