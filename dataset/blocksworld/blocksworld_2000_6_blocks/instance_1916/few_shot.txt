As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the red block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block and the white block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

unstack the blue block from on top of the white block
put down the blue block
unstack the white block from on top of the red block
put down the white block

unstack the red block from on top of the blue block

pick up the blue block

pick up the white block

[PLAN END]
