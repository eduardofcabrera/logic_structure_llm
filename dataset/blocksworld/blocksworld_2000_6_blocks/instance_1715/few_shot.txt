As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the white block, the white block is on top of the blue block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block and the white block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
put down the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the white block
stack the yellow block on top of the orange block
unstack the white block from on top of the blue block
stack the white block on top of the yellow block
unstack the blue block from on top of the red block
put down the blue block
unstack the white block from on top of the yellow block
stack the white block on top of the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the yellow block
[PLAN END]
