As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the white block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the orange block from on top of the white block
put down the orange block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the white block
[PLAN END]
