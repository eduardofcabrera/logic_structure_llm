As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block and the white block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]

stack the red block on top of the blue block
unstack the white block from on top of the yellow block
put down the white block
unstack the red block from on top of the blue block

pick up the white block
stack the white block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]
