As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the white block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN END]
