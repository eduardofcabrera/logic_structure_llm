As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the white block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

put down the orange block
unstack the white block from on top of the yellow block
stack the white block on top of the orange block
pick up the blue block

[PLAN END]
