As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the white block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the yellow block
unstack the white block from on top of the blue block
stack the white block on top of the red block
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
unstack the white block from on top of the red block
stack the white block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]
