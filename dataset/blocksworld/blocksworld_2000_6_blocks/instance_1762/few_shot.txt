As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the white block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN END]
