As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:
