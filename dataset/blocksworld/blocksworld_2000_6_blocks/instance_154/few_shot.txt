As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the white block and the white block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

pick up the yellow block

[PLAN END]
