As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the white block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the white block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
put down the yellow block
unstack the red block from on top of the blue block
put down the red block
unstack the blue block from on top of the white block
put down the blue block
unstack the white block from on top of the orange block
put down the white block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the white block
[PLAN END]
