As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

unstack the white block from on top of the yellow block
put down the white block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the white block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the yellow block
[PLAN END]
