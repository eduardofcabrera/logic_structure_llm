As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the white block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the white block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

stack the orange block on top of the red block
unstack the white block from on top of the blue block
stack the white block on top of the orange block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the white block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]
