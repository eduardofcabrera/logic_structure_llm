As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the white block is on top of the yellow block.
