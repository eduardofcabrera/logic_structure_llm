As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the red block and the white block is on top of the blue block.

[PLAN END]
