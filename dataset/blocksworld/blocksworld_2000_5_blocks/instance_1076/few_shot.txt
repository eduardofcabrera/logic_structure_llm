As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the white block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the white block, the blue block is on top of the orange block and the white block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:
