As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the white block.

My plan is as follows:

put down the white block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the white block
[PLAN END]
