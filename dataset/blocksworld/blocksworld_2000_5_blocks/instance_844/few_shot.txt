As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the white block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the white block is on top of the red block.

[PLAN END]
