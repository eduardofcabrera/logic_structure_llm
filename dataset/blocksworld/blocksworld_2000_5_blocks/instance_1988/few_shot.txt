As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the white block.

[PLAN END]
