As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the white block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the white block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN END]
