As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the white block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the yellow block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the white block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN END]
