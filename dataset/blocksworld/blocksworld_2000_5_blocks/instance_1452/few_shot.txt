As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the white block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the white block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
unstack the white block from on top of the red block
stack the white block on top of the orange block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the white block
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block
put down the red block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]
