As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the white block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the blue block and the white block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

unstack the blue block from on top of the white block
put down the blue block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
put down the yellow block
unstack the white block from on top of the orange block

pick up the orange block

[PLAN END]
