As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the white block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the white block from on top of the orange block
put down the white block
unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block
put down the orange block
unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block
put down the blue block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]
