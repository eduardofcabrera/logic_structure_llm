As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the white block, the red block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the white block.

My plan is as follows:

unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block
put down the orange block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]
