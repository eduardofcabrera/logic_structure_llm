As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the white block, the white block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the white block and the blue block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the white block
put down the yellow block
unstack the white block from on top of the red block
put down the white block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the white block
[PLAN END]
