As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the white block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.

unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block

put down the orange block
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block
