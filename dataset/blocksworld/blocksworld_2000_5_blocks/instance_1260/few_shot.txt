As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the white block, the yellow block is on the table and the white block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the white block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the red block from on top of the blue block
put down the red block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
stack the blue block on top of the yellow block
unstack the orange block from on top of the white block
put down the orange block
unstack the blue block from on top of the yellow block
stack the blue block on top of the white block
[PLAN END]
