As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the white block, the white block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the white block and the white block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

unstack the white block from on top of the yellow block
stack the white block on top of the orange block
pick up the red block

stack the blue block on top of the white block
[PLAN END]
