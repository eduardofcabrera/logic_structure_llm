As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

[PLAN END]
