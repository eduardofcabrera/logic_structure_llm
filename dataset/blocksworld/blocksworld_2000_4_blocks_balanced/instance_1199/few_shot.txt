As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
put down the red block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the orange block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the yellow block
[PLAN END]
