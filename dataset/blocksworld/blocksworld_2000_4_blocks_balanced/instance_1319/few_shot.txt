As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

put down the blue block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
unstack the orange block from on top of the red block

[PLAN END]
