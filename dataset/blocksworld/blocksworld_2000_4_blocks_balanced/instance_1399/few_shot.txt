As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the orange block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

unstack the blue block from on top of the red block
put down the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block

[PLAN END]
